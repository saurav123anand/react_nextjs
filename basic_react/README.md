npm install -D parser 
here -D stands for dev dependency 

there are two types of dependency: dev and normal dependency 
since parser is a bundler that we are gonna use in development phase that's why installing it as a dev dependency 

`npm` is used to install the dependency and `npx` is used to execute the dependency 
### example:

`npm install parcel 
npx parcel index.html`
